        the greatest allegiance <br /><br />
        we could ever give <br /><br />
        is to the Lord Jesus <br /><br />
        and all that He did <br /><br />

      To have a Gospel-centered mentality in all things, especially within the
      context of social and political issues, is often equated with apathy and
      carelessness. Unfortunately, there are way too many examples of Christians
      speaking the truth without love, those who's theology has not yet
      translated into daily action. But we cannot let these poor examples
      diminish our view of the power of the Word of God to transform lives. Any
      life. Any background. No matter how dark the soul, the Gospel is always
      capable of bringing light. We all must humble ourselves. We all must
      repent. And God is gracious to incline His ear to the suffering, the
      broken-hearted. Jesus Christ said, "my Kingdom is not of this world" not
      to discourage practical love, but emphasize the fact that our ultimate
      allegiance belongs to Him. Pray We All Repent is an effort to remember
      that, and to live it out.

        For a moment I forgot the stars existed<br />
        I was busy looking down<br />
        Inches from my eyes into a world<br />
        That only ever seems to drown<br />
        If not for holy sanity I’d miss<br />
        The universe for specks of dust<br />
        A fire comes for all of it <br />But mercifully it never comes for us<br /><br />
        And right beneath my feet familiar streets<br />
        In the place where I was born<br />
        Cell towers flashing nearby in the east<br />
        It’s the view before my home <br />The backyard maple’s bigger than
        before<br />
        Cause it never ceased to grow<br />
        Despite a thousand talking heads<br />
        Predicting when the world is gonna blow<br />
        Like I’ve been bracing for imminent death<br />
        While my Jesus loves me so<br /><br />
        Living things grow like they always have <br />Before my wandering,
        wondering eyes <br />Where nothing is okay<br />But by His grace
        <br />Everything will be alright<br /><br />
        Last night my friend asked me <br />If I’d burned with homesickness to
        despair<br />
        “Pseudo-suicidal” was our word<br />
        We won’t do it but we’re scared<br />
        And I said the want to die is easy <br />But it’s worth the dark undone
        <br />To stick it out and watch the maple grow <br />In the
        death-defying Son <br />Where raging waves and wars are all we know<br />
        And the war’s already won <br /><br />Brothers laughing off the temporal
        dark <br />All awash in brilliant light Where nothing is okay <br />But
        by His grace <br />Everything will be alright<br />
        <br />What is it your looking for<br />
        Leaning into all those awful sounds?<br />
        Go outside and praise the Lord<br />
        Leave that world and lay your armor down<br />
        Crumble neath the endless weight<br />
        Of glory that is greater than the wounds <br />And cast those little
        death of yours<br />
        To watch Him bring perspective to this tomb <br />We’re all lying in<br />
        Cause if He lives <br />
        Where we’re lying in <br />
        We’re all lying, then...<br />
        <br />
        We’re alive in Him<br />
        So with this second wind I’ve stumbled on <br />Let me let the Spirit
        blow<br />
        Right into your taxing lungs from mine <br />Let’s live out this living
        hope<br />
        <br />
        Ever breathing only by the strength <br />
        Of His eternal might<br />
        Where nothing is okay <br />But by His grace <br />Everything will be
        alright<br />
        <br />
        So show affection through the storm <br />Heap those burning coals<br />
        Unclench your fists <br />Kiss the waves <br />For we may die
        tomorrow<br />
        But we won’t die like this<br /><br /><br />
