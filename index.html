      <p>
        For a moment I forgot the stars existed<br />
        I was busy looking down<br />
        Inches from my eyes into a world<br />
        That only ever seems to drown<br />
        If not for holy sanity I’d miss<br />
        The universe for specks of dust<br />
        A fire comes for all of it <br />But mercifully it never comes for us<br /><br />
        And right beneath my feet familiar streets<br />
        In the place where I was born<br />
        Cell towers flashing nearby in the east<br />
        It’s the view before my home <br />The backyard maple’s bigger than
        before<br />
        Cause it never ceased to grow<br />
        Despite a thousand talking heads<br />
        Predicting when the world is gonna blow<br />
        Like I’ve been bracing for imminent death<br />
        While my Jesus loves me so<br /><br />
        Living things grow like they always have <br />Before my wandering,
        wondering eyes <br />Where nothing is okay<br />But by His grace
        <br />Everything will be alright<br /><br />
        Last night my friend asked me <br />If I’d burned with homesickness to
        despair<br />
        “Pseudo-suicidal” was our word<br />
        We won’t do it but we’re scared<br />
        And I said the want to die is easy <br />But it’s worth the dark undone
        <br />To stick it out and watch the maple grow In the death-defying Son
        <br />Where raging waves and wars are all we know<br />
        And the war’s already won <br /><br />Brothers laughing off the temporal
        dark <br />All awash in brilliant light Where nothing is okay <br />But
        by His grace <br />Everything will be alright<br />
        <br />What is it your looking for<br />
        Leaning into all those awful sounds?<br />
        Go outside and praise the Lord<br />
        Leave that world and lay your armor down<br />
        Crumble neath the endless weight<br />
        Of glory that is greater than the wounds And cast those little death of
        yours<br />
        To watch Him bring perspective to this tomb <br />We’re all lying in<br />
        Cause if He lives <br />
        Where we’re lying in <br />
        We’re all lying, then...<br />
        <br />
        We’re alive in Him<br />
        So with this second wind I’ve stumbled on <br />Let me let the Spirit
        blow<br />
        Right into your taxing lungs from mine <br />Let’s live out this living
        hope<br />
        <br />
        Ever breathing only by the strength <br />
        Of His eternal might<br />
        Where nothing is okay <br />But by His grace <br />Everything will be
        alright<br />
        <br />
        So show affection through the storm <br />Heap those burning coals<br />
        Unclench your fists Kiss the waves <br />For we may die tomorrow<br />
        But we won’t die like this<br /><br /><br />
      </p>
